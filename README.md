## Inspiration
Making something takes confidence, and nothing builds confidence like concrete evidence that we're headed in the right direction. But evidence is hard to come by in the world of new technologies and tools. We started with a question like: “How might technologies change the ways programming communities share their code?” and include a suggested prototype like: “Build a product that will allow developers to quickly share their code snippets.” This level of specificity felt stifling at first—but it helped us get moving fast toward a prototype.

## Our Solution
After 36 grueling hours, we designed Snippt, a mobile application that streamlines the processes of sending and sharing code with others. Using optical character recognition and a proprietary formatting algorithm, users can quickly capture code they want to save or share without going through applications that are not designed for code sharing.

## How we built it
We built Snippt with:
* Swift Native as backend and front-end
* Google's Optical Character Recoginition (Firebase API)
* Figma for UI/UX design (modular design)

## Challenges we ran into
* Not enough time to fully implement front-end
* Apple iOS 13.3 update doesn't support Snippt functionality
* Constant changing of coding languages (Swift, React Native, Expo)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Exploration was about charting unfamiliar territory. Sometimes that means we get it all wrong and end up at a dead-end. But that doesn’t mean the sprint was a failure! As we realized, the goal of an exploratory sprint was not to execute a million dollar idea in record time, but to surface new opportunities.

## What we learned
Be aware of major OS updates
Learned Swift, React Native, and Expo
Learned Figma for UI/UX design

## What's next for Snippt
* Support for all major programming languages
* Social platform for support
* Improved UI/UX
* Colorized texts
* Compatibility for iPadOS
